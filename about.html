                    <p> 
                        I was born and raised in Reno, NV. Growing up, I found technology to be intriguing and interesting. 
                        However, not until I attended TMCC would I find my true passion in the world of computing.
                        My first programming language was Python, which is a great and easy language to learn programming fundamentals.
                        Growing off of TMCC, I would transfer to UNR, where I learned C++ and OOP. I am currently a junior interested in software development and expanding my knowledge of computing.
